# 🕸️ Web Scraping Demo — Quotes to Scrape  
**By Anjal Bhattarai**

This project demonstrates how to use **Python** with **BeautifulSoup** and **requests** to scrape data from the [Quotes to Scrape](http://quotes.toscrape.com/) website.  
It extracts **quotes**, **authors**, and **tags** from the page and stores them in a structured format using **pandas**, and finally exports the data to a CSV file.
